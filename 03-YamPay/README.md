## Challenge Details

### Background
Welcome to your local yam market! As more people get interested in cryptocurrency, a friendly yam seller wants to learn how to accept ‚Ç≥da payments. Your task is to help them understand the basics of Cardano wallets and simple transactions.

3. **First Steps with Transactions:**
   - Learn how to create a simple transaction
   - Show if the transaction was successful

### Success Criteria
