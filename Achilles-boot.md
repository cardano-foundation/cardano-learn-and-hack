DA log, Epoch 555:

Encountered a peculiar anomaly in the realm of cryptocurrency. [Intelligence suggests](https://forum.cardano.org/c/english/report-a-scam/184) that "hacks"still occur on Cardano, compromising security and user experience. Furthermore, so-called "hardware wallets" possess potential to mitigate this malady, but their limitations hindering accessibility render them ineffective.

Seeking solution, [propose development](https://github.com/aleeusgr/achilles-boot) of technology capable of converting smartphone into Cardano wallet. Theorem: device, once rendered "airgapped," could then facilitate transaction signing in coordination with companion application operating on separate smartphone. 

Implications exceed mere cryptocurrency realm. Such airgapped technology holds promise for safeguarding "secrets" universally. Conceivable applications extend to confidential information management, thereby bolstering data protection throughout the cosmos.
