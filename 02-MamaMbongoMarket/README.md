# Mama Mbongo's Micro-Loan DeFi Market

## Difficulty: Advanced ðŸš€

## Category: DeFi ðŸ’°

## Description
A fictional Cameroonian market woman, Mama Mbongo, wants to offer micro-loans using Cardano smart contracts. In this challenge, participants will create a minimal DeFi contract that supports lending and repayment of ADA with basic interest. Integrate a JS front-end for simulation. Emphasize financial inclusion through blockchain.

## Challenge Details

### Background
In many African markets, informal lending systems play a crucial role in supporting small businesses. Mama Mbongo, a respected market vendor in Cameroon, sees the potential of blockchain technology to make these lending systems more efficient and accessible.

### Your Task
Create a DeFi application that implements:

1. **Smart Contract Requirements:**
   - Implement lending pool functionality
   - Allow users to deposit ADA as lenders
   - Enable borrowers to request micro-loans
   - Implement basic interest calculation
   - Include loan repayment functionality
   - Handle basic error conditions

2. **Frontend Requirements:**
   - Create a simple web interface for:
     - Connecting Cardano wallets
     - Depositing funds as a lender
     - Requesting loans as a borrower
     - Viewing loan status and repayment schedule
     - Making repayments

### Success Criteria
- Smart contract correctly handles lending and borrowing operations
- Interest calculations work as expected
- Frontend successfully interacts with the smart contract
- Basic error handling is implemented
- Documentation explains how to test and use the system

### Bonus Points
- Implement collateral requirements
- Add a reputation system
- Include multiple loan duration options
- Create a mobile-responsive design
- Add localization support (especially for African languages)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your Cardano development environment
3. Implement the smart contract
4. Create the frontend interface
5. Test thoroughly with testnet ADA
